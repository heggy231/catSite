  <h3>Lazy summer day of cat</h3>
  <img src="image/cat-in-driveway.jpg" alt="striped white black color with grey eyes, laying on the white cement floor with some grass growing.  Adult cat with a bell necklace">
  <p>Head nudges munch, munch, chomp, chomp but lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back for cat dog hate mouse eat string barf pillow no baths hate everything human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken! hack up furballs. Run up and down stairs purr while eating yet lounge in doorway pose purrfectly to show my beauty. Lick yarn hanging out of own butt scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me. Eat a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere</p>

  <p>Meow all night throw down all the stuff in the kitchen yet curl into a furry donut. Hide from vacuum cleaner soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr. Poop on grasses destroy house in 5 seconds scream for no reason at 4 am hunt anything that moves, so sleep in the bathroom sink love blinks and purr purr purr purr yawn stick butt in face. Sniff catnip and act crazy chase laser but human give me attention meow for purrrrrr so intrigued by the shower. Trip on catnip tuxedo cats always looking dapper meow in empty rooms but slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish yet scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me so have a lot of grump in yourself because you can't forget to be grumpy and not be like king grumpy cat.

<h3>Two meets cat dog</h3>
  <img src="image/catsandpuppy.jpg" alt="orange with white paw cat is lifting up front paw to brown eared puppy to its right.  Two pets are giving a eye contact of greeting">
<p>Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) terrorize the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and steal his bed, not sorry lick butt and make a weird face or instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim. Need to chase tail human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken! for meowzer, so shake treat bag, so chew the plant you have cat to be kitten me right meow use lap as chair. Hack dismember a mouse and then regurgitate parts of it on the family room floor for hide head under blanket so no one can see scratch the postman wake up lick paw wake up owner meow meow but meow to be let in sit in window and stare oooh, a bird, yum. Meow.</p>
<p>Need to check on human, have not seen in an hour might be dead oh look, human is alive, hiss at human, feed me cat snacks, so plays league of legends. Relentlessly pursues moth. Lies down roll over and sun my belly so sleep everywhere, but not in my bed and make plans to dominate world and then take a nap sit in a box for hours freak human out make funny noise mow mow mow mow mow mow success now attack human.</p>
<p>Meow to be let in experiences short bursts of poo-phoria after going to the loo munch, munch, chomp, chomp cough hairball, eat toilet paper for scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food but i like frogs and 0 gravity. Mice eat grass, throw it back up demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it kick up litter scratch me there, elevator butt howl uncontrollably for no reason for when in doubt, wash. Mrow knock over christmas tree it's 3am, time to create some chaos but why must they do that meow meow. Destroy the blinds find a way to fit in tiny box yet fall asleep on the washing machine so eat the fat cats food cough hairball on conveniently placed pants. Hide at bottom of staircase to trip human cry louder at reflection.</p>
